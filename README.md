# Wordle Clone

This project is a simple clone of the popular word game Wordle. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers a minimalistic interface where players can guess a word within six attempts. Each guess provides feedback in the form of color changes to indicate when letters match or occupy the correct position.

## Features

- **Clean UI**: A grid layout for displaying guesses and keyboard input for interaction.
- **Feedback System**: Color-coded hints to help players find the correct word.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project does not have any prerequisites as it's purely front-end and can be run in any modern web browser.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://yourprojectlink.git
sh

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

## Usage

To play the game, simply start typing to enter guesses. After each guess, press `Enter` to submit. The game provides feedback for each letter in your guess:

- **Green**: The letter is in the word and in the correct position.
- **Yellow**: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- **Grey**: The letter is not in the word.

The goal is to guess the correct word within six attempts.
